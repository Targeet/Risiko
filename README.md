# Risiko
A little modified AND simplified version of risiko written in c for the terminal.
The game can accomodate an infinite number of players as long as there are enough countries.
The game doesn't have the feature where you can attack only the countries near the border,
so you would be able, for example, to attack Spain from Italy, which is not how the real game works.
A missing feature it's also that the players can only own 1 country at a time, in the real game players
would be able to own all the countries that they want.

I preferred to put work on well done features instead of doing a high number of features.
